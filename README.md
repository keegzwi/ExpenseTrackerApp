## Contributions

* Caden: Created the base app with basic pages/screens. Created a basic home Screen, add expense screen, add categories screen. Added date functionality on adding entries. Added comments to make code more readable.

* Will: Refined the screens and made them user friendly. Added ability to add description to expenses. Made expenses entries into cards in the Home Screen with neatly laid out text placement. Created statistics screen using the charts library to display all of the categories in a pie chart. Also added comments to make code more readable. 

## Known Errors

* None
(Besides that if you run an older version of Xcode before 15.3 it will have errors as the charts library was not introduced. So make sure you are on newest version)

## Build Instructions

* Use Xcode 15.3 as charts library was not introduced in previous versions. 
* Run simulation on iOS 17.4 or above simulator
